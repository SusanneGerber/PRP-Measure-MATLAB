# PRP_Measure_MATLAB
Matlab-Script from the paper S. Gerber and I. Horenko  "On computation of relations between categorical data  sets and application to genomics", 2016

It demonstrates an application of the Posterior Relation Probability measure (PRP-measure) to an analysis of the human SNP data (Single Nucleotide
 Polymorphisms or point mutations in a human genome)
data from L. Huang, et.al. Human Genetics, 2015

Start by opening the file "PRP_HGDP_Example.m" with Matlab.

Licence for an Optimisation Toolbox of Matlab is required for the constrained minimisation problem solution (can be substituted by user-defined routines).
